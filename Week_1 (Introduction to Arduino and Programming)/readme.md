# Week 1
*PLEASE READ THIS  FOR INSTRUCTIONS OF HOW TO OPEN AND USE THE CREATED PROGRAMS AND DESCRIPTION OF THOSE PROGRAMS
*DETAILED QUESTIONS ARE GIVEN IN THE PDF PROVIDED -- WEEK 1
* THIS WEEK COVERS BASIC PYTHON PROGRAMMING AND BASICS OF ARDUINO PROGRAMMING
* TINKERCAD CODES ARE PROVIDED WITH SCREENSHOTS OF CIRCUIT AND PUBLIC LINKS##

#### PYTHON QUESTIONS
QUESTION 1
- TRY TO RUN THE PROGRAM IN PYTHON 2.7
- PROVISE 10 INPUTS AS NUMBERS 
- THE PROGRAM WILL GIVE BACK THE PRIME NUMBERS AMONG THEM

QUESTION 2
-RUN THE PROGRAM IN PYTHOON 2.7
-THIS IS A SIMPLE CALCULATOR SO SIMPLE ADDITION MULTIPLICATION ETC. CAN BE DONE BY PROVIDING INPUT
