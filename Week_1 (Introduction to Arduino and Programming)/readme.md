##PLEASE READ THIS FILE FOR INSTRUCTIONS OF HOW TO OPEN AND USE THE CREATED PROGRAMS AND DESCRIPTION OF THOSE PROGRAMS##
##THIS WEEK COVERS BASIC PYTHON PROGRAMMING AND BASICS OF ARDUINO PROGRAMMING##
##TINKERCAD CODES ARE PROVIDED WITH SCREENSHOTS OF CIRCUIT AND PUBLIC LINKS##
#I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO USE SUBLIME TEXT EDITOR TO WATCH THE CONTENTS OF ALL THE CODE FILE#
#DETAILED QUESTIONS ARE GIVEN IN THE PDF PROVIDED -- WEEK 1

##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------##
##PYTHON QUESTIONS##
#QUESTION 1#
--TRY TO RUN THE PROGRAM IN PYTHON 2.7
--PROVISE 10 INPUTS AS NUMBERS 
--THE PROGRAM WILL GIVE BACK THE PRIME NUMBERS AMONG THEM

#QUESTION 2#
--RUN THE PROGRAM IN PYTHOON 2.7
--THIS IS A SIMPLE CALCULATOR SO SIMPLE ADDITION MULTIPLICATION ETC. CAN BE DONE BY PROVIDING INPUT

#QUESTION 3#
##IN THIS QUESTION RUN THE PROGRAM BY PYTHON 3 OR LATER ##
--YOU CAN ADD MUTIPLE CODERS TILL YOU WISH TO EXIT 
--PROGRAM WILL ASK YOU IF YOU WANT TO USE CREATED METHODS TO MAKE CHANGESS IN INFO AND GET INTRO
--THE PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE NECESSARY INFO TO NAVIAGTE AND USE METHODS
