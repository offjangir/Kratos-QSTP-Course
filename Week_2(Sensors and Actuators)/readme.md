##PLEASE READ THIS FILE FOR INSTRUCTIONS OF HOW TO OPEN AND USE THE CREATED PROGRAMS AND DESCRIPTION OF THOSE PROGRAMS##
##THIS WEEK COVERS BASIC PYTHON PROGRAMMING AND BASICS OF ARDUINO PROGRAMMING##
##TINKERCAD CODES ARE PROVIDED WITH SCREENSHOTS OF CIRCUIT AND PUBLIC LINKS##
#I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO USE SUBLIME TEXT EDITOR TO WATCH THE CONTENTS OF ALL THE CODE FILE#
#DETAILED QUESTIONS ARE GIVEN IN THE PDF PROVIDED -- WEEK 2

##-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------##
##PYTHON QUESTIONS##
#QUESTION 1#
--TRY TO RUN THE PROGRAM IN PYTHON 3 
--PROVIDE INPUTS AS X1 Y1 Z1 WUTH SPACES AND  PRESS ENTER
--THE PROGRAM WILL GIVE BACK THE POINTS QITH SHORTEST DISTANCE ID SAME POINTS ARE GIVEN THEN WILL SHOW THE POINTS THAT WERE ENTERED FIRST
#QUESTION 2#
--RUN THE PROGRAM IN PYTHON 3
--GIVE INPUT AS THE 100 HOUSES O-1 FOR NOT INFECTED-INFRCTED SEPARATED BY SPACE
--YOU CAN PORVIDE THE COORDINATES OF THE HOUSES AND THEN CALCULATE
